> ### Worship


**Ashura**, also known as the The Searing Soul, and the God of Fire and Light, is a prominent member of the [[4. Faith and Religion/2. Old Gods/2. Old Gods\|Old Gods]]. He is known to be as wrathful as wildfire, yet as comforting as a hearth. As blistering as a furnace, yet as warm as hug. This relationship between scorching and warmth comprises the modern view of Ashura. His worshippers seek enlightenment, seeking to burn away corruption and falsehoods with the holy flame.

## Practices
### Prayer
Followers of the Faith of the Searing Soul, always pray before an open flame. Whether that is a campfire, torch, or even a lit match, regardless a flame must be present. A common sentiment in prayers to Ashura, is to ask that they sun may return so that it can rid the world of the cold night. 

Some extremely radical worshippers have been known to brand themselves with hot iron, to dedicate their lives to Ashura. 

### Marriage
When two followers of the Searing Soul wish to wed, they must first gather with a priest and their families before a large bonfire. The priest then guides the couple through a series of ceremonial prayers before asking the couple to grab a log from the bonfire. That log will emerge with a message of symbol on it which will either bless or curse this union. 

### Death
