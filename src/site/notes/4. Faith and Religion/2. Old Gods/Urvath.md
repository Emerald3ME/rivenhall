**Urvath**, known also as the [[4. Faith and Religion/2. Old Gods/2. Old Gods\|Old God]] of the Depths, is a dark and ancient deity revered by many seaside settlements in the farthest reaches of [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall\|Rivenhall]] and the known world. Much like the rest of the old gods, Urvath's faith has stood the test of time. In many regions the **faith of the depths** has defied all attempts to surmount it with the more popular faith of the [[4. Faith and Religion/1. New Gods/1. New Gods\|New Gods]] pushed by the mighty [[3. Characters/Groups/Church of Hallowed Light/Church of Hallowed Light\|Church of Hallowed Light]]. Along countless shores, the worship of Urvath pulses at the core of coastal life, fueling a relentless devotion to the sea and its neigh unstoppable power.
