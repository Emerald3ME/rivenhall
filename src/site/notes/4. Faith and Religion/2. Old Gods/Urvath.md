**Urvath**, known also as the [[4. Faith and Religion/2. Old Gods/2. Old Gods\|Old God]] of the Depths, is a dark and ancient deity revered by many seaside settlements in the farthest reaches of Rivenhall and the known world. Much like the rest of the old gods, Urvath's faith has stood the test of time. In many regions the faith of the depths has defied all attempts to surmount it with the more popular faith of the [[4. Faith and Religion/1. New Gods/1. New Gods\|New Gods]] pushed by the mighty [[3. Characters/Groups/Church of Hallowed Light/Church of Hallowed Light\|Church of Hallowed Light]]. On many a coast worship of Urvath is at the very heart of a seaside life, for it nourishes fierce devotion to the sea and it's might.
