The **Rainlands** is one of the 9 regions comprising the [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall\|Kingdom of Rivenhall]]. While it's lands are beautifully green, lush, and farmable, it's skies are almost always of a dark grey menagerie. This lack of sunshine has many effects on both the populace and the wildlife, but both make strong efforts to pull through. 

## Geography
The Rainlands are comprised of plains, forests, hills, and endless rivers. Many of the major rivers start atop high hills and rush towards the nearby sea. As the name implies, the Rainlands receive frequent precipitation which is often very light but still persistent. When it is not raining the clouds hang plentiful and dark grey in the sky, signaling the near inevitable rainfall. 

The vegetation that grows in the Rainlands has adapted over many decades to prevent themselves from drowning in the over abundance of moisture. Many large leafs can be found as canopies to shelter small animals and small vegetation alike. Moss and ivy can be found on almost any surface it could possibly grow. 

## Seasons
In the Rainlands it is said that only spring exists here. While there is light snowfall one or twice a year, it quickly turns into a wet sludge and melts away. 

## People, Society, and Culture
The Rainlands are generally considered to be an incredibly fertile ground for specialized form of vegetation and fruit. The numerous rivers that exist throughout are also incredibly useful for transporting both people and goods alike. It is common to see small merchant vessels attempting to make a sale by the river or seaside.
