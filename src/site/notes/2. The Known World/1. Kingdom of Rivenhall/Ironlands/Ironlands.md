the **Ironlands** is one of the nine regions of [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall\|Rivenhall]]. 
## Geography
The Ironlands is a region off the southeast coast of [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall\|Rivenhall]]. The Ironlands is contending for the smallest of the nine regions. It is a barely fertile land of grey rocks with sharp jagged terrain and steep cliffs. Many of the buildings in the Ironlands are forced to conform themselves to the steep verticality it offers.  

## Seasons

## People, Society, and Culture
The people of the Ironlands are similar to those of the [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/Winterlands/Winterlands\|Winterlands]] as they are both somewhat isolated. As the Winterlands are isolated by their harsh climate conditions, the Ironlands are isolated by their sharp treacherous terrain that could easily fling someone off a cliff without caution. The people of the Ironlands are known for their agility, balance, strength, independence, and a harsh "survival of the fittest" mentality. Their worship of the Old Gods is an essential part off their culture and helps shape their cultural identity. 

## Economy
As expected, the main resource available in the Ironlands is Iron and other minerals akin to it. Therefore there are many mines that populate the Ironlands to retrieve such minerals and metals from the earth. Since it is located on the southeast coast, it also provides abundant fish and other sea life.
