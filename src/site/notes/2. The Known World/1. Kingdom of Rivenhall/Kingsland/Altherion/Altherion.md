**Altherion** is the capital of the [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall\|Kingdom of Rivenhall]], located in the [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/Kingsland/Kingsland\|Kingsland]] on the southwest coast. Altherion is the site of the Gilded Citadel, which houses the king [[3. Characters/Groups/Lesser Houses of Rivenhall/House Valemont/Edmund Valemont\|Edmund]] of [[3. Characters/Groups/Lesser Houses of Rivenhall/House Valemont/House Valemont\|House Valemont]].  The main city is surrounded by a sizable wall manned by the cities guard. Altherion contends for the most populous city in all of the Kingdom, however this has lead to many impoverished and unkept areas throughout the city. It's population density has gotten to the point that the poorest of Altherion's residents have been forced to build their sketchily built homes outside the wall.
