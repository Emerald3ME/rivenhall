The **Firetail Tavern** is a quaint new addition to the bustling streets of [[2. The Known World/1. Kingdom of Rivenhall/Kingsland/Altherion/Altherion\|Altherion]] city. Nestled on a cobbled street, this cozy little tavern boasts a warm, inviting glow. It's namesake is inspired by the flickering flame of a hearth that dances like a fire's tail. Though its charm is undeniable, this tavern is still a work in progress—a bit of a fixer-upper, with mismatched furniture and the faint scent of freshly cut wood lingering in the air. Its owner [[1. Party Name/Kenko\|Kenko]] and his employees great their patrons with decently well-crafted food and drink. The Firetail Tavern’s rough-hewn polished cobble walls, wooden floors, and low beams add to its rustic, homey appeal.
