# Pathfinder 2nd Edition Rules Reference
## [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/)
The _Archives of Nethys_ is an official online resource for the _Pathfinder_ role-playing game, created and maintained by Paizo Publishing. It provides a comprehensive, searchable database of game rules, including information on spells, monsters, items, classes, feats, abilities, and much more, all from the _Pathfinder_ role-playing universe.

Admittedly it isn't the sexiest website, but it definitely gets the job done! 

## [PF2Easy](https://pf2easy.com/)
A fantastic rules reference site that is centralized around a powerful and accurate search engine. Fantastic for desktop use, mobile use works as well, however the experience isn't as seamless. 

## [Pathfinder 2e Nexus (Demiplane)](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/pathfinder2e/rules?srsltid=AfmBOoqameBtIU7-v0DfUu9Lq6b4Kc0dhReXoowZNe6MAjeLLXA0miI9)
Pathfinder 2e Nexus is a solid source for Pathfinder 2e rules. It was built by a lot of the same people who created D&D Beyond, and has a similar aesthetic to that site.
